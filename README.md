# LeetCode Progress

## Purpose 
<p> <b> This repo is solely for the storing of my LeetCode solutions as I progress in completing them. I want to ensure that I can review and learn from my progress in the near future. This is mostly to improve my problem solving skills and for fun as well. Most of the solutions may be out of order, incomplete or inefficent (in terms of time-complexity and space) for the time being.  </b> </p>

## Contents 

<p> <b> All Solutions will be written in Python3, if at any given moment I decide to switch the langauge used I will add an additional folder outlining those specific langauges to the repo.  </b> </p>
